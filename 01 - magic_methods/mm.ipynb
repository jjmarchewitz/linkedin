    "`__init__(self)` lets you set up a new object right after it's created. Python reserves the name `__init__` so that any method with that name will be treated as the initial startup method. The double underscore pattern indicates that the method name is reserved by the language, and Python contains many more of these than just `__init__`. A useful one is `__eq__`, which lets you customize when two items are equal (`==`)."

You can even add instance variables and *instance methods* to a normal function. Yes, `function1.function2()` is possible, everything is possible with Python! I'll cover this in a future lightning round, but for now here's a great video on the topic: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnKxKFXB4NQ\n"
